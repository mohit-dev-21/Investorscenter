      <h1 class="mar">LEARN INVESTING IN GOLD</h1>
      <p>With the stock markets swinging in the extremes this year due to the economic impact of the pandemic, most investors were prompted to find ways to hedge their portfolios. During this period, one asset started gaining traction – Gold. If you have been considering investing in gold but are unsure about how to begin, here is a quick guide to acquaint you with gold investing in India. Read on!
</p>
<h4> <b>Why Should You Consider Investing in Gold?</b> </h4>
<p>While people in India have brought gold over for various reasons, usually cultural or religious, it has found appeal as an investment option as well. Here are a few things that work in favor of gold:
</p>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Long-term store of value </b>– For centuries, gold has been the best store of value for the long-term(store of value is an asset that maintains its value without depreciating). The fact that it can play the role of money adds to its superiority and its outperformance of the currency value make it attractive.
</li>
<li><b>It will always have value </b>– Currency is a ‘promise to pay’. Gold, on the other hand, requires no such promise. It is the only financial asset that is not someone else’s liability at the same time. In its 3000+ year history, gold prices have never dropped to zero. Hence, it will always have value and stand strong even if the market collapses.
</li>
<li><b>Inflation hedge</b> – When inflation rates rise, the value of currency drops. However, over the last five years, despite the rise in inflation rates, gold prices have doubled. In India, where inflation rates tend to exceed interest rates, investing in gold is a hedge against inflation.
</li>
<li><b>No specialized knowledge needed </b>– When you buy stocks or invest in mutual funds, you need some knowledge of the market and economy to make the right decision. With gold, no such knowledge is needed. It is simple and straightforward making it easy to invest in for all kinds of investors.
</li>
<li><b>Helps diversify your investment portfolio</b> – As an asset class, gold has a low/negative correlation with other asset classes. Hence, it is helpful in diversifying or hedging your investment portfolio against market volatility.
</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<h4> <b>What are the Different Ways of Investing in Gold?</b> </h4>
<p><ol>
  <li>
    <h5> <b> 1) Digital Gold</b> </h5>
One of the most convenient and cost-effective ways of investing in gold online is Digital Gold. This product allows you to buy and sell gold in fractions at any time. You can invest in gold with as little as Rs.10! Every bit of digital gold purchased by you is backed by physical 24k gold and linked to the real-time gold prices. Here are some features and benefits of buying digital gold.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h5> <b>2) Gold coins or Bars</b> </h5>
    To save on ‘making charges’ that are applicable to gold jewelry, many investors opt for gold coins or bars. Since these coins/bars do not require skilled artistry, the making charges are not applicable. Today, you can buy these coins or bars from jewelers, banks, ecommerce websites, and many non-banking finance companies.
  </li>
  <li> <h5> <b>3) Gold Savings Schemes</b> </h5>
    Jewelers across India offer various schemes to help people invest in gold in installments. Typically, a jeweler allows you to deposit a pre-determined amount every month for a specific period. At the end of the tenure, they can buy gold from the same jeweler at a value equal to the amount deposited plus a bonus (if offered by the jeweler). The gold can be purchased at the prevalent gold price on maturity.
  </li>
  <li> <h5> <b>4) Gold Sovereign Bonds</b> </h5>
    Issued by the Reserve bank of India (RBI), Gold Sovereign Bonds are the safest way to purchase digital gold. The RBI issues them on behalf of the Indian Government. These bonds have an assured interest of 2.50% per annum. The bonds have a lock-in period of five years and an overall tenure of eight years.
